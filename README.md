### About
This project is part of the [Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree] under the name  - *Project P5: Make You App Material*. The application was originally named as *xyz reader*.


```
Project Overview
 In this project, you will redesign an app to follow the Material Design guidelines and translate a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app.

Why this Project?
 This project gives you an opportunity to improve an app’s design, a vital skill for building apps users will love. It also replicates a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.

What Will I Learn?
 Through this project, you will:
  • Understand the fundamentals of Android design.
  • Apply Material Design guidelines to an mobile application.
  • Separate an interface into surfaces.
  • Effectively use transitions and motion.
